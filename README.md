# ChordM8

Music chord progression inspiration and crowdsourced rankings! ðŸŽ¸

## Motivation

I challenged myself to build ChordM8 to continue practicing React.js while applying the CSS layout and flexbox skills I learned on [FrontEndMasters](https://frontendmasters.com), including flexbox and media queries for responsive layout. I also wanted to experiment using Firebase Firestore database with React.js.

The app uses the latest version of React, including hooks for state management, Google Firebase Firestore database, hosted and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
